# Udemy First React Assignmenet Modified
I have modified the assignment a little bit in order to make it more difficult and interesting. The actual assignent is way too easy and not fit for good students. 

# What's new in this assignment
We have four paragraphs in our project. These paragraphs come from UserOutput container. Each container contains 2 paragraph and we have two such containers. There is one Input field. Whatever we type in the Input field will reflect in the content of the selected paragraph. The selected paragraph will be highlighted in red border.
